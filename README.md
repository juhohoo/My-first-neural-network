# My-first-neural-network

This repository has a Python file "my_first_neural_network.py" that has my first ever neural network coded. I'm using PyTorch library to create a neural network with two linear hidden layers and tanh as the activation function. The neural network is used to classify data consisting of tweets into three categories. Data is available in the attached tar file.
